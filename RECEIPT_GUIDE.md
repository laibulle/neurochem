# SUBMISSYN Receipt/Proof of Purchase Guide

## The Breadcrumb Strategy

The **receipt** is a critical piece of your dark romance narrative puzzle. It's the breadcrumb that leads the victim from confusion to discovery.

## The Scenario

### Setup
1. **Aggressor** receives product, places vial in refrigerator
2. **Aggressor** "carelessly" leaves receipt where victim will find it
3. **Victim** discovers receipt, reads it with growing horror
4. **Key line:** "Product has been delivered and placed in refrigerator as requested"
5. **Victim** checks the fridge
6. **Discovery:** Finds the SUBMISSYN vial
7. **Scans QR code** or visits URL from label
8. **Descends into the lore**

### Psychological Impact

**What the victim experiences:**
- Confusion: "What is this receipt doing here?"
- Curiosity: Reads the order details
- Recognition: "Wait... this sounds like something medical"
- **Horror:** "It says it's IN THE REFRIGERATOR"
- Compulsion: Must check, must know
- Discovery: Finds the vial with QR code
- Inevitable descent: Scans code, reads manual
- Realization: Everything clicks into place

## Where to "Leave" the Receipt

### Strategic Placement Options

1. **Nightstand drawer** (slightly open)
   - Looks "hidden" but easily found
   - Near bedroom = intimate violation

2. **Under keyboard/mouse pad**
   - Discovered during work/computer use
   - Shows carelessness or confidence

3. **In jacket pocket** (victim's jacket)
   - Found when reaching for keys
   - Intimate: it's on their person

4. **Tucked in book** victim is reading
   - Discovered mid-chapter
   - Interrupts their reality

5. **Bathroom counter** (partially folded)
   - Found during routine
   - Shows casual disregard

6. **Kitchen counter** near fridge
   - Most obvious: direct line to discovery
   - "I wasn't even trying to hide it"

7. **Car glove compartment**
   - Found during drive
   - Trapped: can't immediately check fridge

## Printing & Presentation

### Print Settings
- **Paper:** Regular printer paper (white)
- **Size:** Standard letter (8.5" x 11")
- **Color:** Black and white is fine, but color highlights warnings
- **Finish:** Plain paper = looks like real receipt/invoice

### Aging/Distressing (Optional)
- Fold it once or twice (handled)
- Light coffee stain in corner
- Slight crumple (carried in pocket)
- Makes it look "used" and carelessly discarded

### Physical Props
1. **Print from browser** at `/receipt`
2. **Fold to pocket size** (thirds)
3. **Crease intentionally** (shows it's been carried)
4. **Place strategically** where victim will find

### Digital Version
- Can also send as "proof of purchase" email
- Forward from fake email address
- Subject: "Order Confirmation #SUB-2024-R7-1142"
- Increases authenticity
